# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

### `cp .env.example .env`

### `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://fakestoreapi.com npm start`

### Since testing was not explicitly mentioned, I've not put emphasis on it

### Tried to create some synergy between the API and UX by creating a local store while still sending the requests to https://fakestoreapi.com/
